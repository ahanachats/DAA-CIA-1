Comparison report:

All 3 algorithms are unable to handle negative directed graphs.
Therefore, an alternate approach would be to use the Bellmann-Ford algorithm.
It finds the shortest path from the source vertex to all the other vertices in a weighted graph.
However, it is slower than Djikstra's as it handles graphs with negative edges.

Justification for chosen language:

I have chosen C as we have learnt these algorithms in C language in the previous semester. 
It is not an object oriented language but I am comfortable coding these algorithms in C.
